RNA-seq Analysis Exercise | https://usegalaxy.org/u/jeremy/p/galaxy-rna-seq-analysis-exercise | ./dataset/BodyMap | Small samples of datasets from the Illumina BodyMap 2.0 project; specifically, the datasets are paired-end 50bp reads from adrenal and brain tissues. The sampled reads map mostly to a 500Kb region of chromosome 19, positions 3-3.5 million (chr19:3000000:3500000)
